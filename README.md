# Check Weather

> Check Weather is a web application that enables users all over the world to check the current weather of a perticular city by typing the name of the city and clicking on search.

> The web application by default provides users with a five-day weekly forecast of weather codition, wind speed, maximum and minimum temperatures in the lower section.
This forecast starts right from the current day. Thus, unless a user is looking for a different city's current weather, he or she can easily find the weather in his or her city without a search.
